Introduction

Migrations are like version control for your database, allowing your team to define and share the application's database schema definition. If you have ever had to tell a teammate to manually add a column to their local database schema after pulling in your changes from source control, you've faced the problem that database migrations solve.

The Laravel Schema facade provides database agnostic support for creating and manipulating tables across all of Laravel's supported database systems. Typically, migrations will use this facade to create and modify database tables and columns.
Generating Migrations

You may use the make:migration Artisan command to generate a database migration. The new migration will be placed in your database/migrations directory. Each migration filename contains a timestamp that allows Laravel to determine the order of the migrations:

1php artisan make:migration create_flights_table

Laravel will use the name of the migration to attempt to guess the name of the table and whether or not the migration will be creating a new table. If Laravel is able to determine the table name from the migration name, Laravel will pre-fill the generated migration file with the specified table. Otherwise, you may simply specify the table in the migration file manually.

If you would like to specify a custom path for the generated migration, you may use the --path option when executing the make:migration command. The given path should be relative to your application's base path.

Migration stubs may be customized using stub publishing.
Squashing Migrations

As you build your application, you may accumulate more and more migrations over time. This can lead to your database/migrations directory becoming bloated with potentially hundreds of migrations. If you would like, you may "squash" your migrations into a single SQL file. To get started, execute the schema:dump command:

1php artisan schema:dump

2 

3# Dump the current database schema and prune all existing migrations...

4php artisan schema:dump --prune

When you execute this command, Laravel will write a "schema" file to your application's database/schema directory. The schema file's name will correspond to the database connection. Now, when you attempt to migrate your database and no other migrations have been executed, Laravel will first execute the SQL statements in the schema file of the database connection you are using. After executing the schema file's SQL statements, Laravel will execute any remaining migrations that were not part of the schema dump.

If your application's tests use a different database connection than the one you typically use during local development, you should ensure you have dumped a schema file using that database connection so that your tests are able to build your database. You may wish to do this after dumping the database connection you typically use during local development:

1php artisan schema:dump

2php artisan schema:dump --database=testing --prune

You should commit your database schema file to source control so that other new developers on your team may quickly create your application's initial database structure.

Migration squashing is only available for the MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite databases and utilizes the database's command-line client.
Migration Structure

A migration class contains two methods: up and down. The up method is used to add new tables, columns, or indexes to your database, while the down method should reverse the operations performed by the up method.

Within both of these methods, you may use the Laravel schema builder to expressively create and modify tables. To learn about all of the methods available on the Schema builder, check out its documentation. For example, the following migration creates a flights table:

 1<?php

 2 

 3use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;

 4use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;

 5use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

 6 

 7return new class extends Migration

 8{

 9    /**

10     * Run the migrations.

11     */

12    public function up(): void

13    {

14        Schema::create('flights', function (Blueprint $table) {

15            $table->id();

16            $table->string('name');

17            $table->string('airline');

18            $table->timestamps();

19        });

20    }

21 

22    /**

23     * Reverse the migrations.

24     */

25    public function down(): void

26    {

27        Schema::drop('flights');

28    }

29};

Setting the Migration Connection

If your migration will be interacting with a database connection other than your application's default database connection, you should set the $connection property of your migration:

 1/**

 2 * The database connection that should be used by the migration.

 3 *

 4 * @var string

 5 */

 6protected $connection = 'pgsql';

 7 

 8/**

 9 * Run the migrations.

10 */

11public function up(): void

12{

13    // ...

14}

Skipping Migrations

Sometimes a migration might be meant to support a feature that is not yet active and you do not want it to run yet. In this case you may define a shouldRun method on the migration. If the shouldRun method returns false, the migration will be skipped:

 1use App\Models\Flight;

 2use Laravel\Pennant\Feature;

 3 

 4/**

 5 * Determine if this migration should run.

 6 */

 7public function shouldRun(): bool

 8{

 9    return Feature::active(Flight::class);

10}

Running Migrations

To run all of your outstanding migrations, execute the migrate Artisan command:

1php artisan migrate

If you would like to see which migrations have already run and which are still pending, you may use the migrate:status Artisan command:

1php artisan migrate:status

If you would like to see the SQL statements that will be executed by the migrations without actually running them, you may provide the --pretend flag to the migrate command:

1php artisan migrate --pretend

Isolating Migration Execution

If you are deploying your application across multiple servers and running migrations as part of your deployment process, you likely do not want two servers attempting to migrate the database at the same time. To avoid this, you may use the isolated option when invoking the migrate command.

When the isolated option is provided, Laravel will acquire an atomic lock using your application's cache driver before attempting to run your migrations. All other attempts to run the migrate command while that lock is held will not execute; however, the command will still exit with a successful exit status code:

1php artisan migrate --isolated

To utilize this feature, your application must be using the memcached, redis, dynamodb, database, file, or array cache driver as your application's default cache driver. In addition, all servers must be communicating with the same central cache server.
Forcing Migrations to Run in Production

Some migration operations are destructive, which means they may cause you to lose data. In order to protect you from running these commands against your production database, you will be prompted for confirmation before the commands are executed. To force the commands to run without a prompt, use the --force flag:

1php artisan migrate --force

Rolling Back Migrations

To roll back the latest migration operation, you may use the rollback Artisan command. This command rolls back the last "batch" of migrations, which may include multiple migration files:

1php artisan migrate:rollback

You may roll back a limited number of migrations by providing the step option to the rollback command. For example, the following command will roll back the last five migrations:

1php artisan migrate:rollback --step=5

You may roll back a specific "batch" of migrations by providing the batch option to the rollback command, where the batch option corresponds to a batch value within your application's migrations database table. For example, the following command will roll back all migrations in batch three:

1php artisan migrate:rollback --batch=3

If you would like to see the SQL statements that will be executed by the migrations without actually running them, you may provide the --pretend flag to the migrate:rollback command:

1php artisan migrate:rollback --pretend

The migrate:reset command will roll back all of your application's migrations:

1php artisan migrate:reset

Roll Back and Migrate Using a Single Command

The migrate:refresh command will roll back all of your migrations and then execute the migrate command. This command effectively re-creates your entire database:

1php artisan migrate:refresh

2 

3# Refresh the database and run all database seeds...

4php artisan migrate:refresh --seed

You may roll back and re-migrate a limited number of migrations by providing the step option to the refresh command. For example, the following command will roll back and re-migrate the last five migrations:

1php artisan migrate:refresh --step=5

Drop All Tables and Migrate

The migrate:fresh command will drop all tables from the database and then execute the migrate command:

1php artisan migrate:fresh

2 

3php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

By default, the migrate:fresh command only drops tables from the default database connection. However, you may use the --database option to specify the database connection that should be migrated. The database connection name should correspond to a connection defined in your application's database configuration file:

1php artisan migrate:fresh --database=admin

The migrate:fresh command will drop all database tables regardless of their prefix. This command should be used with caution when developing on a database that is shared with other applications.
Tables
Creating Tables

To create a new database table, use the create method on the Schema facade. The create method accepts two arguments: the first is the name of the table, while the second is a closure which receives a Blueprint object that may be used to define the new table:

1use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;

2use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

3 

4Schema::create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {

5    $table->id();

6    $table->string('name');

7    $table->string('email');

8    $table->timestamps();

9});

When creating the table, you may use any of the schema builder's column methods to define the table's columns.
Determining Table / Column Existence

You may determine the existence of a table, column, or index using the hasTable, hasColumn, and hasIndex methods:

 1if (Schema::hasTable('users')) {

 2    // The "users" table exists...

 3}

 4 

 5if (Schema::hasColumn('users', 'email')) {

 6    // The "users" table exists and has an "email" column...

 7}

 8 

 9if (Schema::hasIndex('users', ['email'], 'unique')) {

10    // The "users" table exists and has a unique index on the "email" column...

11}

Database Connection and Table Options

If you want to perform a schema operation on a database connection that is not your application's default connection, use the connection method:

1Schema::connection('sqlite')->create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {

2    $table->id();

3});

In addition, a few other properties and methods may be used to define other aspects of the table's creation. The engine property may be used to specify the table's storage engine when using MariaDB or MySQL:

1Schema::create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {

2    $table->engine('InnoDB');

3 

4    // ...

5});

The charset and collation properties may be used to specify the character set and collation for the created table when using MariaDB or MySQL:

1Schema::create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {

2    $table->charset('utf8mb4');

3    $table->collation('utf8mb4_unicode_ci');

4 

5    // ...

6});

The temporary method may be used to indicate that the table should be "temporary". Temporary tables are only visible to the current connection's database session and are dropped automatically when the connection is closed:

1Schema::create('calculations', function (Blueprint $table) {

2    $table->temporary();

3 

4    // ...

5});

If you would like to add a "comment" to a database table, you may invoke the comment method on the table instance. Table comments are currently only supported by MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL:

1Schema::create('calculations', function (Blueprint $table) {

2    $table->comment('Business calculations');

3 

4    // ...

5});

Updating Tables

The table method on the Schema facade may be used to update existing tables. Like the create method, the table method accepts two arguments: the name of the table and a closure that receives a Blueprint instance you may use to add columns or indexes to the table:

1use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;

2use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

3 

4Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {

5    $table->integer('votes');

6});

Renaming / Dropping Tables

To rename an existing database table, use the rename method:

1use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

2 

3Schema::rename($from, $to);

To drop an existing table, you may use the drop or dropIfExists methods:

1Schema::drop('users');

2 

3Schema::dropIfExists('users');

Renaming Tables With Foreign Keys

Before renaming a table, you should verify that any foreign key constraints on the table have an explicit name in your migration files instead of letting Laravel assign a convention based name. Otherwise, the foreign key constraint name will refer to the old table name.
Columns
Creating Columns

The table method on the Schema facade may be used to update existing tables. Like the create method, the table method accepts two arguments: the name of the table and a closure that receives an Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint instance you may use to add columns to the table:

1use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;

2use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

3 

4Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {

5    $table->integer('votes');

6});

Column Modifiers

In addition to the column types listed above, there are several column "modifiers" you may use when adding a column to a database table. For example, to make the column "nullable", you may use the nullable method:

1use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;

2use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

3 

4Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {

5    $table->string('email')->nullable();

6});

The following table contains all of the available column modifiers. This list does not include index modifiers:
Modifier 	Description
->after('column') 	Place the column "after" another column (MariaDB / MySQL).
->autoIncrement() 	Set INTEGER columns as auto-incrementing (primary key).
->charset('utf8mb4') 	Specify a character set for the column (MariaDB / MySQL).
->collation('utf8mb4_unicode_ci') 	Specify a collation for the column.
->comment('my comment') 	Add a comment to a column (MariaDB / MySQL / PostgreSQL).
->default($value) 	Specify a "default" value for the column.
->first() 	Place the column "first" in the table (MariaDB / MySQL).
->from($integer) 	Set the starting value of an auto-incrementing field (MariaDB / MySQL / PostgreSQL).
->instant() 	Add or modify the column using an instant operation (MySQL).
->invisible() 	Make the column "invisible" to SELECT * queries (MariaDB / MySQL).
->lock($mode) 	Specify a lock mode for the column operation (MySQL).
->nullable($value = true) 	Allow NULL values to be inserted into the column.
->storedAs($expression) 	Create a stored generated column (MariaDB / MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite).
->unsigned() 	Set INTEGER columns as UNSIGNED (MariaDB / MySQL).
->useCurrent() 	Set TIMESTAMP columns to use CURRENT_TIMESTAMP as default value.
->useCurrentOnUpdate() 	Set TIMESTAMP columns to use CURRENT_TIMESTAMP when a record is updated (MariaDB / MySQL).
->virtualAs($expression) 	Create a virtual generated column (MariaDB / MySQL / SQLite).
->generatedAs($expression) 	Create an identity column with specified sequence options (PostgreSQL).
->always() 	Defines the precedence of sequence values over input for an identity column (PostgreSQL).
Default Expressions

The default modifier accepts a value or an Illuminate\Database\Query\Expression instance. Using an Expression instance will prevent Laravel from wrapping the value in quotes and allow you to use database specific functions. One situation where this is particularly useful is when you need to assign default values to JSON columns:

 1<?php

 2 

 3use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

 4use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;

 5use Illuminate\Database\Query\Expression;

 6use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;

 7 

 8return new class extends Migration

 9{

10    /**

11     * Run the migrations.

12     */

13    public function up(): void

14    {

15        Schema::create('flights', function (Blueprint $table) {

16            $table->id();

17            $table->json('movies')->default(new Expression('(JSON_ARRAY())'));

18            $table->timestamps();

19        });

20    }

21};

Support for default expressions depends on your database driver, database version, and the field type. Please refer to your database's documentation.
Column Order

When using the MariaDB or MySQL database, the after method may be used to add columns after an existing column in the schema:

1$table->after('password', function (Blueprint $table) {

2    $table->string('address_line1');

3    $table->string('address_line2');

4    $table->string('city');

5});

Instant Column Operations

When using MySQL, you may chain the instant modifier onto a column definition to indicate that the column should be added or modified using MySQL's "instant" algorithm. This algorithm allows certain schema changes to be performed without a full table rebuild, making them nearly instantaneous regardless of table size:

1$table->string('name')->nullable()->instant();

Instant column additions can only append columns to the end of the table, so the instant modifier cannot be combined with the after or first modifiers. In addition, the algorithm does not support all column types or operations. If the requested operation is incompatible, MySQL will raise an error.

Please refer to MySQL's documentation to determine which operations are compatible with instant column modifications.
DDL Locking

When using MySQL, you may chain the lock modifier onto column, index, or foreign key definitions to control table locking during schema operations. MySQL supports several lock modes: none allows concurrent reads and writes, shared allows concurrent reads but blocks writes, exclusive blocks all concurrent access, and default lets MySQL choose the most appropriate mode:

1$table->string('name')->lock('none');

2 

3$table->index('email')->lock('shared');

If the requested lock mode is incompatible with the operation, MySQL will raise an error. The lock modifier may be combined with the instant modifier to further optimize schema changes:

1$table->string('name')->instant()->lock('none');

Modifying Columns

The change method allows you to modify the type and attributes of existing columns. For example, you may wish to increase the size of a string column. To see the change method in action, let's increase the size of the name column from 25 to 50. To accomplish this, we simply define the new state of the column and then call the change method:

1Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {

2    $table->string('name', 50)->change();

3});

When modifying a column, you must explicitly include all the modifiers you want to keep on the column definition - any missing attribute will be dropped. For example, to retain the unsigned, default, and comment attributes, you must call each modifier explicitly when changing the column:

1Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {

2    $table->integer('votes')->unsigned()->default(1)->comment('my comment')->change();

3});

The change method does not change the indexes of the column. Therefore, you may use index modifiers to explicitly add or drop an index when modifying the column:

1// Add an index...

2$table->bigIncrements('id')->primary()->change();

3 

4// Drop an index...

5$table->char('postal_code', 10)->unique(false)->change();

Renaming Columns

To rename a column, you may use the renameColumn method provided by the schema builder:

1Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {

2    $table->renameColumn('from', 'to');

3});

Dropping Columns

To drop a column, you may use the dropColumn method on the schema builder:

1Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {

2    $table->dropColumn('votes');

3});

You may drop multiple columns from a table by passing an array of column names to the dropColumn method:

1Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {

2    $table->dropColumn(['votes', 'avatar', 'location']);

3});

Available Command Aliases

Laravel provides several convenient methods related to dropping common types of columns. Each of these methods is described in the table below:
Command 	Description
$table->dropMorphs('morphable'); 	Drop the morphable_id and morphable_type columns.
$table->dropRememberToken(); 	Drop the remember_token column.
$table->dropSoftDeletes(); 	Drop the deleted_at column.
$table->dropSoftDeletesTz(); 	Alias of dropSoftDeletes() method.
$table->dropTimestamps(); 	Drop the created_at and updated_at columns.
$table->dropTimestampsTz(); 	Alias of dropTimestamps() method.
Indexes
Creating Indexes

The Laravel schema builder supports several types of indexes. The following example creates a new email column and specifies that its values should be unique. To create the index, we can chain the unique method onto the column definition:

1use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;

2use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

3 

4Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {

5    $table->string('email')->unique();

6});

Alternatively, you may create the index after defining the column. To do so, you should call the unique method on the schema builder blueprint. This method accepts the name of the column that should receive a unique index:

1$table->unique('email');

You may even pass an array of columns to an index method to create a compound (or composite) index:

1$table->index(['account_id', 'created_at']);

When creating an index, Laravel will automatically generate an index name based on the table, column names, and the index type, but you may pass a second argument to the method to specify the index name yourself:

1$table->unique('email', 'unique_email');

Available Index Types

Laravel's schema builder blueprint class provides methods for creating each type of index supported by Laravel. Each index method accepts an optional second argument to specify the name of the index. If omitted, the name will be derived from the names of the table and column(s) used for the index, as well as the index type. Each of the available index methods is described in the table below:
Command 	Description
$table->primary('id'); 	Adds a primary key.
$table->primary(['id', 'parent_id']); 	Adds composite keys.
$table->unique('email'); 	Adds a unique index.
$table->index('state'); 	Adds an index.
$table->fullText('body'); 	Adds a full text index (MariaDB / MySQL / PostgreSQL).
$table->fullText('body')->language('english'); 	Adds a full text index of the specified language (PostgreSQL).
$table->spatialIndex('location'); 	Adds a spatial index (except SQLite).
Online Index Creation

By default, creating an index on a large table can lock the table and block reads or writes while the index is being built. When using PostgreSQL or SQL Server, you may chain the online method onto an index definition to create the index without locking the table, allowing your application to continue reading and writing data during index creation:

1$table->string('email')->unique()->online();

When using PostgreSQL, this adds the CONCURRENTLY option to the index creation statement. When using SQL Server, this adds the WITH (online = on) option.
Renaming Indexes

To rename an index, you may use the renameIndex method provided by the schema builder blueprint. This method accepts the current index name as its first argument and the desired name as its second argument:

1$table->renameIndex('from', 'to')

Dropping Indexes

To drop an index, you must specify the index's name. By default, Laravel automatically assigns an index name based on the table name, the name of the indexed column, and the index type. Here are some examples:
Command 	Description
$table->dropPrimary('users_id_primary'); 	Drop a primary key from the "users" table.
$table->dropUnique('users_email_unique'); 	Drop a unique index from the "users" table.
$table->dropIndex('geo_state_index'); 	Drop a basic index from the "geo" table.
$table->dropFullText('posts_body_fulltext'); 	Drop a full text index from the "posts" table.
$table->dropSpatialIndex('geo_location_spatialindex'); 	Drop a spatial index from the "geo" table (except SQLite).

If you pass an array of columns into a method that drops indexes, the conventional index name will be generated based on the table name, columns, and index type:

1Schema::table('geo', function (Blueprint $table) {

2    $table->dropIndex(['state']); // Drops index 'geo_state_index'

3});

Foreign Key Constraints

Laravel also provides support for creating foreign key constraints, which are used to force referential integrity at the database level. For example, let's define a user_id column on the posts table that references the id column on a users table:

1use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;

2use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

3 

4Schema::table('posts', function (Blueprint $table) {

5    $table->unsignedBigInteger('user_id');

6 

7    $table->foreign('user_id')->references('id')->on('users');

8});

Since this syntax is rather verbose, Laravel provides additional, terser methods that use conventions to provide a better developer experience. When using the foreignId method to create your column, the example above can be rewritten like so:

1Schema::table('posts', function (Blueprint $table) {

2    $table->foreignId('user_id')->constrained();

3});

The foreignId method creates an UNSIGNED BIGINT equivalent column, while the constrained method will use conventions to determine the table and column being referenced. If your table name does not match Laravel's conventions, you may manually provide it to the constrained method. In addition, the name that should be assigned to the generated index may be specified as well:

1Schema::table('posts', function (Blueprint $table) {

2    $table->foreignId('user_id')->constrained(

3        table: 'users', indexName: 'posts_user_id'

4    );

5});

You may also specify the desired action for the "on delete" and "on update" properties of the constraint:

1$table->foreignId('user_id')

2    ->constrained()

3    ->onUpdate('cascade')

4    ->onDelete('cascade');

An alternative, expressive syntax is also provided for these actions:
Method 	Description
$table->cascadeOnUpdate(); 	Updates should cascade.
$table->restrictOnUpdate(); 	Updates should be restricted.
$table->nullOnUpdate(); 	Updates should set the foreign key value to null.
$table->noActionOnUpdate(); 	No action on updates.
$table->cascadeOnDelete(); 	Deletes should cascade.
$table->restrictOnDelete(); 	Deletes should be restricted.
$table->nullOnDelete(); 	Deletes should set the foreign key value to null.
$table->noActionOnDelete(); 	Prevents deletes if child records exist.

Any additional column modifiers must be called before the constrained method:

1$table->foreignId('user_id')

2    ->nullable()

3    ->constrained();

Dropping Foreign Keys

To drop a foreign key, you may use the dropForeign method, passing the name of the foreign key constraint to be deleted as an argument. Foreign key constraints use the same naming convention as indexes. In other words, the foreign key constraint name is based on the name of the table and the columns in the constraint, followed by a "_foreign" suffix:

1$table->dropForeign('posts_user_id_foreign');

Alternatively, you may pass an array containing the column name that holds the foreign key to the dropForeign method. The array will be converted to a foreign key constraint name using Laravel's constraint naming conventions:

1$table->dropForeign(['user_id']);

Toggling Foreign Key Constraints

You may enable or disable foreign key constraints within your migrations by using the following methods:

1Schema::enableForeignKeyConstraints();

2 

3Schema::disableForeignKeyConstraints();

4 

5Schema::withoutForeignKeyConstraints(function () {

6    // Constraints disabled within this closure...

7});

SQLite disables foreign key constraints by default. When using SQLite, make sure to enable foreign key support in your database configuration before attempting to create them in your migrations.
Events

For convenience, each migration operation will dispatch an event. All of the following events extend the base Illuminate\Database\Events\MigrationEvent class:
Class 	Description
Illuminate\Database\Events\MigrationsStarted 	A batch of migrations is about to be executed.
Illuminate\Database\Events\MigrationsEnded 	A batch of migrations has finished executing.
Illuminate\Database\Events\MigrationStarted 	A single migration is about to be executed.
Illuminate\Database\Events\MigrationEnded 	A single migration has finished executing.
Illuminate\Database\Events\NoPendingMigrations 	A migration command found no pending migrations.
Illuminate\Database\Events\SchemaDumped 	A database schema dump has completed.
Illuminate\Database\Events\SchemaLoaded 	An existing database schema dump has loaded.
